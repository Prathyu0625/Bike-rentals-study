## General Information
-Project Background: Bike-sharing programs have grown significantly, and understanding demand patterns is crucial for operational efficiency. Predicting daily rental counts helps bike-sharing companies manage bike availability, staffing, and maintenance more effectively.
-Business Problem: The project addresses the challenge of predicting bike rental demand, allowing companies to allocate resources efficiently and meet customer needs during peak times.
-Dataset: The dataset includes daily rental data with features such as:
-Date: Day on which rentals were recorded
-Season: Seasonal category (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
-Year: Rental year (e.g., 2018, 2019)
-Month, Holiday, Weekday: Indicators of time and holidays
-Weather Conditions: Categorical variable describing weather (clear, cloudy, rainy)
-Temperature Variables: Temperature, adjusted temperature, humidity, and wind speed
-Count (cnt): The target variable representing daily bike rentals

## Conclusions
- Seasonal Demand: Higher rentals are observed in warmer seasons (Summer, Fall), especially on clear days.
-Temporal Trend: Bike rentals show an upward trend over time, indicating growing adoption.
-Weather Sensitivity: Adverse weather conditions, like rain, lead to lower rentals.
-Feature Importance: Temperature, year, and season are significant predictors of rental demand.
